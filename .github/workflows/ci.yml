# ============================================
# CI Workflow: Continuous Integration
# ============================================
# Purpose: Test and validate code quality on every push/PR
# This runs BEFORE code is merged to ensure it's good

name: CI - Test & Build

# ============================================
# TRIGGERS: When should this workflow run?
# ============================================
on:
  # Run on pushes to these branches
  push:
    branches: [main]
  
  # Run on pull requests targeting these branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# ============================================
# JOBS: What work should be done?
# ============================================
jobs:
  # Job 1: Run all tests
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    # Use Ubuntu Linux (it's free on GitHub!)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Strategy: Test on multiple Node versions (optional)
    # This ensures your app works on different versions
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x]

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code from GitHub
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          # Cache npm packages - makes future runs faster
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # npm ci is like npm install but for CI (faster, more reliable)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Check code style (ESLint)
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Run unit tests (fast tests)
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm run test:unit

      # Step 6: Run integration tests (slower, more comprehensive)
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration

      # Step 7: Generate code coverage report
      # Shows what % of your code is tested
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: npm run coverage:unit

      # Step 8: Upload coverage to Codecov (optional)
      # Shows coverage badges on your README
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          files: ./coverage/lcov.info
          flags: unittests
          name: codecov-umbrella
